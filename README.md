# ManageIQ-Summer-Internship-2018

## Reuben Varghese:
### Updates until July 17th:

* Deployed ManageIq on an AWS server as my local workstation does not have enough
resources to effectively run the application.
* Understood the working of models and the use, usage of pytest framework in
running integration tests on ManageIq
* Successfully installed Selenium over VNC and also setup the testing environment
for running ManageIq integration tests. Unfortunately, since the resources are
limited locally, I plan to redo the installation on my AWS server that houses
ManageIq currently.

## Amritraj Singh:
### Updates until July 19th:
* Configured ManageIQ running in a docker container on a local linux system.
* Launched a virtual Machine on EC2 and succesfully added and reviewed as a provider to the ManageIQ worksystem.
* Tried adding a GCE provider as well, however couldn't succeed owing to a validation problem.
* Successfully installed Selenium over VNC, however, couldn't have been able to run the miq docker container over selenium owing to an error. Intend to redo the installation process.
* Acquired theoretical familiarity with pyTest framework in their usage in ManageIQ Integration Tests.
