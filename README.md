# ManageIQ-Summer-Internship-2018

## Reuben Varghese:
### Updates until July 17th:

* Deployed ManageIq on an AWS server as my local workstation does not have enough
resources to effectively run the application.
* Understood the working of models and the use, usage of pytest framework in
running integration tests on ManageIq
* Successfully installed Selenium over VNC and also setup the testing environment
for running ManageIq integration tests. Unfortunately, since the resources are
limited locally, I plan to redo the installation on my AWS server that houses
ManageIq currently.

### Update 2nd October:
* Collection conversion of Menu (Merged)
* Collection conversion of Assignment (Almost merged. Mostly today itself)
* Collection conversion of Config Management( PR Created. Need to fix a few failing tests)

## Amritraj Singh:
### Updates until July 19th:

* Configured ManageIQ running in a Docker container on the local Linux system.
* Deployed virtual machine on EC2 and successfully added and configured it as a provider in ManageIQ.
* Tried adding a GCE provider as well, however, couldn't because of an error.
* Successfully installed Selenium over VNC to get my system configured for the testing environment. However, platform limitations have refrained me from deploying the ManageIQ container within the selenium server. So, I'd be switching to a more suitable platform (Fedora), to solve this particular issue.
* Acquired a theoretical understanding of widgets, models and usage of Pytest framework for running integration tests on ManageIQ.
